# Clever Coding Challenge
This is my submission for the Clever SWE Intern 2021 Coding Challenge.

## Build
This program contains an executable inside of `clever_coding_challenge/distr`. The program can be run easily through:
```bash
cd clever_coding_challenge
./scheduler math.json
```

## Program Design

## Considerations and Future Improvements

## Time Complexity
